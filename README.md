This project involves exploring, cleaning, and feature engineering on a dataset of breast cancer patients. 
In Part 1, we prepare the data by modifying and creating features. 
In Part 2, we apply supervised machine learning models to solve two problems: a classification problem to predict patient survival and a regression problem to estimate the remaining months of survival. 
We evaluate model performance and identify the best approaches for both tasks.
