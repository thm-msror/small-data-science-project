# Breast Cancer Patient Survival Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of breast cancer patients to gain insights and build predictive models that can assist in medical prognosis.

## Overview

The project is divided into two main parts:

### Part 1: Data Preparation and Feature Engineering

- **Exploration**: Understand the structure, distribution, and patterns within the dataset.
- **Cleaning**: Handle missing values, incorrect types, and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and modify existing ones to improve model performance.

### Part 2: Supervised Machine Learning

We address two predictive tasks:

#### 1. **Classification Task**  
- **Objective**: Predict whether a patient will survive.
- **Approach**: Apply various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.

#### 2. **Regression Task**  
- **Objective**: Estimate the remaining number of months a patient is expected to survive.
- **Approach**: Apply regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, RÂ² Score.

## Goals

- Gain insight into the factors affecting patient survival.
- Build accurate and interpretable models for classification and regression.
- Evaluate model performance and identify the best techniques for each problem.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results

The best-performing models for each task are selected based on evaluation metrics. Key insights and interpretations are shared to support clinical decision-making.
